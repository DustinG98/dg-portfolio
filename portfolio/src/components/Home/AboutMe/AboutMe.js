            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m from Albuquerque, New Mexico where I work as a freelance full stack (MERN) developer. 
                I’m looking for a full time software engineer role.<br/> My focus is in software engineering because I love to problem solve, 
                and I love seeing code come to life. I received my education from Lambda School’s Full-Stack Program. 
                <br/>In my spare time I’m a book enthusiast, huge Star Wars fan, and a father of a beautiful little girl.</p>
